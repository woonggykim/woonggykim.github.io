**OPC UA** provides secure, interoperable machine-to-machine communication and standardized information models.

### Selected Work
- **Paper:** *OPC-UA Communication Framework for PLC-based Industrial IoT Applications*, **IEEE IoTDI**, 2017.  
  Integrated PLCopen OPC UA client/server into an open-source PLC platform; supported sync/async communication with real-time constraints.
- **Paper:** *Standalone OPC UA Wrapper for Industrial Monitoring and Control Systems*, **IEEE Access**, 2018.  
  UA wrapper to bridge modern OPC UA systems with legacy **OPC Classic** via shared memory and event-driven updates.

### Impact
- Reduced latency, improved interoperability across heterogeneous systems.
- Cost-effective modernization path from OPC Classic.
