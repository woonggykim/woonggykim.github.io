Modern vehicles are **software-defined** and connected, demanding secure, high-bandwidth in-vehicle networks and intelligent sensing.

### Selected Work
- **Patent:** *Method and Apparatus for Sensing Occupant in a Vehicle* (**KR102635461B1**).  
  Uses existing **UWB** nodes (digital key) + lightweight on-device AI (CIR stats) for occupant detection—no extra sensors.
- **MACsec Integration:** Designed and implemented **MACsec** for automotive Ethernet to secure controller traffic in next-gen E/E architectures.
- **Cybersecurity Backend:** Built **UN ECE R155**-compliant cybersecurity information management backend (Spring Boot + MariaDB).

### Impact
- Secure Ethernet-based control networks for SDVs.
- On-device AI improves privacy, reliability, and latency under constrained compute.
