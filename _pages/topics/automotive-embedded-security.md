## Overview

Modern vehicles are sophisticated, networked computing platforms. Embedded systems control safety-critical and connected features—from braking and steering to infotainment and cloud-based services—making them potential targets for cyberattacks.
Automotive embedded security ensures these systems remain safe, protect data, and comply with global cybersecurity regulations.

## My Research & Contributions

At Hyundai AutoEver Corp., I am directly involved in building security into the automotive E/E architecture:

- In-Vehicle Network Security: MACsec-based Ethernet protection
- Platform Security Architecture: Secure Boot, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Cybersecurity Backend: Built **UN ECE R155**-compliant cybersecurity information management backend (Spring Boot + MariaDB).

**Technical Innovations:**

- Repurposed existing Digital Key 3.0 UWB infrastructure for occupant detection—no additional dedicated sensors required.
- Machine learning model (CNN) trained to detect subtle variations in UWB CIR patterns caused by occupant presence.

## Selected Work

- **Patent:** *Method and Apparatus for Sensing Occupant in a Vehicle* (**KR102635461B1**).  
- **MACsec Integration:** Designed and implemented **MACsec** for automotive Ethernet to secure controller traffic in next-gen E/E architectures.
- **Cybersecurity Backend:** Built **UN ECE R155**-compliant cybersecurity information management backend (Spring Boot + MariaDB).
