I am **Woonggy (Peter) Kim**, a Senior Software Engineer at **Hyundai Autoever Corp.** specializing in **industrial automation**, **real-time control networks**, and **automotive embedded security**.

I hold both a **Ph.D.** and **B.E.** in Mechanical Information Engineering from the **University of Seoul**.  
My work spans:

- **Industrial Automation & Control Systems:** EtherCAT synchronization, distributed real-time, and standardized data exchange with **OPC UA**.  
- **Automotive Embedded Security:** MACsec integration for automotive Ethernet, **on-device AI** sensing (UWB occupant detection), and **UN ECE R155** compliance.

I focus on bridging legacy systems with modern standards, advancing secure communication protocols, and deploying intelligent embedded systems for future mobility and manufacturing.

## How to Pronounce My Name

My Korean name is **Woonggy** (웅기).  
It is pronounced as:

**[Woong-gi]**

- The first syllable **“Woong”** has a long “oo” sound, like the “oo” in *moon*, and ends with the "ng" sound, as in the English word *song*.
- The second syllable **“gi”** is pronounced like *ghee* (the beginning of *give* without the “v” sound).  

Phonetic transcription (IPA): **/uːŋ-gi/**

For easier communication, I also go by my English nickname: **Peter**.  

Please feel free to call me either **Woonggy** or **Peter**.
