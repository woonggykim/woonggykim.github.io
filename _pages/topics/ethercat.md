**EtherCAT** is a real-time Ethernet technology for industrial control.

### Selected Work
- **Patent:** *Method and System for EtherCAT-Based Distributed Clock Synchronization* (**KR101492910B1**).  
  Calculates per-slave delays and automatically adjusts the master’s distributed clock to achieve tight cycle synchronization.
- **Paper:** *Evaluation of EtherCAT Clock Synchronization in Distributed Control Systems*, **Trans. KSME A**, 2014.  
  Real-system measurements and optimization methods for distributed control.

### Impact
- Higher motion precision for robotics/manufacturing.
- Minimal hardware changes; software-driven synchronization tuning.
